## Heinermann's ONI Mods

Collection of mods I've made. Click a project for a description.

### Developing
~~Copy missing ONI assembly assets to `<root>/lib/`. Build.~~ I changed the project references to point directly to the ONI assembly to use the latest when the game is updated.

### License
*Iron Gate Studio*, and all of its *current and former employees* can choose to use this code under the **MIT license**.

For *everyone else*, this software is licensed under **GPLv3**.
